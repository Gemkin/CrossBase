CrossBase
=========

This library is has been the base of several small and large projects and is a 
collection of serveral utilities, like platform abstrations for testablity. Its
main focus is to give a solid solution for threading by using dispatchers.

The platform abstractions make the library cross-platform prepared, but it need
porting to multiple platforms. 

Environment:
Currently tested with:
* VS2012 .NET 4.5
* Xamarin (code tested, no smooth install procedure yet)



Supported install for using the library
Currently only a smooth install procedure is prepared with Visual Studio 2012. 
Create and new project called 'CrossBase' in you solution. Then install the 
'CrossBase' package from NuGet. Note: the package fails if you do not call the 
project 

Future
* Xamarin support
